/**
* @title Ownable
* @dev The Ownable contract has an owner address, and provides basic authorization control
* functions, this simplifies the implementation of "user permissions".

*taken from the OpenZeppelin Solidity library

*the Ownable contract basically does the following:

    When a contract is created, its constructor sets the owner to msg.sender (the person who deployed it)

    It adds an onlyOwner modifier, which can restrict access to certain functions to only the owner

    It allows you to transfer the contract to a new owner

*onlyOwner is such a common requirement for contracts 
*that most Solidity DApps start with a copy/paste of this Ownable contract, 
*and then their first contract inherits from it.

/*Solidity tips 

   
    Function Modifiers: 
        modifier onlyOwner().
        Modifiers are kind of half-functions that are used to modify other functions, 
        usually to check some requirements prior to execution. 
        In this case, onlyOwner can be used to limit access so only the owner of the 
        contract can run this function.
