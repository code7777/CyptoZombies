    Solidity tips
    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    you can optimize your DApp's gas usage for your users by using 
    read-only external view functions wherever possible.

    view
        functions don't cost any gas when they're called externally by a user

        marking a function with view tells web3.js that it only 
        needs to query your local Ethereum node to run the function

        If a view function is called internally from another function 
        in the same contract that is not a view function, it will still cost gas
    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    
    a transaction on the blockchain would need to be run on every single node, and cost gas.

    Refrence types comprise structs, arrays and mappings. 
    If you use a reference type, you always have to 
    explicitly provide the data area where the type is stored:

        memory (whose lifetime is limited to a function call)

        storage (the location where the state variables are stored)

        calldata (special data location that contains the function arguments,
         only available for external function call parameters).
    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    memory arrays must be created with a length argument
    uint[] memory values = new uint[](3);

     (in this example, 3). 
     As of Solidity 0.5 they cannot be resized like storage arrays can with array.push(), 
     although this may  change in a future version of Solidity.
    One of the more expensive operations in Solidity is using storage â€” particularly writes
    
    TLDR :
    Save on gas , use read-only external view.
    Writing to storage is expensive, use memory inside functions if possible
