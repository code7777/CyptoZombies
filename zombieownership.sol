Solidity tips


    A token on Ethereum is basically just a smart contract that follows some common rules â€” 
    namely it implements a standard set of functions that all other token contracts share,
    such as 
    transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) 
    and 
    balanceOf(address _owner)

    Internally the smart contract usually has a mapping, mapping(address => uint256) balances,
    that keeps track of how much balance each address has.

    ERC20 token basically good for currencies -divisible etc


    ERC20 tokens share the same set of functions with the same names
    This means if you build an application that is capable of interacting with one ERC20 token,
    it's also capable of interacting with any ERC20 token.

    ERC721 tokens good fit for cryptozombies not interchangeable each one is assumed to be unique, and are not divisible. 
    You can only trade them in whole units, and each one has a unique ID.
